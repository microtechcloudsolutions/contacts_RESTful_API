HOW TO USE THE API:
To see how the api works,it was tested using post man(software for testing out REstful API's)

in post man to create a single contact,we passed data to the following url:use "POST http method"

http://localhost:3000/api/contact
data should be sent as a json object like so:
{
	"name":"David",
	"number":"0979789839"
}
The API returns a json file with appropriate response

 where 3000 is the port number of the computer where the API is being tested on
 TO CREATE MULTIPLE CONTACTS:use "POST http method"
 
 http://localhost:3000/api/contacts
 
 NOTE: "contacts" in the url should be in plural form when adding multiple contacts
 contacts are put in an array of objects like so:
 [{
	"name":"petro",
	"number":"09761565"
},
{
	"name":"Mary",
	"number":"2608395735"
},
{
	"name":"chuck",
	"number":"0977760766"
}]
The API returns a json file with appropriate response

TO DELETE A CONTACT:use "delete http method"

when deleting a contact specify the contact number in the url to be deleted like so:
http://localhost:3000/api/contact/0979789839
The API returns a json file with appropriate response

TO UPDATE A CONTACT:use "PATCH http method"

when updating a contact specify the contact number in the url to be updated like so:
http://localhost:3000/api/contact/0979789839
then the contact to be updated should be given in the format:
{
	"name":"petro",
	"number":"09761565"
}
The API returns a json file with appropriate response
 TO FETCH ALL THE CONTACTS:use "GET http method"
 To retrive all the contacts use the url with the "GET" http method:
 http://localhost:3000/api/contacts
